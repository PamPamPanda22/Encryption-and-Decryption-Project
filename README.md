# Encryption-and-Decryption-Project

Description

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key. This secures the data by making it accessible only to those who possess the decryption key, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption, which uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption, which uses a pair of keys (a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption).

In the real world, encryption is used for a variety of purposes. Data protection involves encrypting files on devices or in the cloud, as well as securing sensitive database information. Secure communication is facilitated through email encryption and end-to-end encryption in messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. Web security is enhanced through HTTPS, which encrypts data transmitted between a user's browser and web servers using SSL/TLS.

Features
  - Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext (encrypted text) then back into plaintext
  - Adds randomized bytes of data to the plaintext before encryption to make the ciphertext more secure [salting]
